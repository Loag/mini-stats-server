# mini-stats

A metrics system for resoure constrained environments

## Overview

The general purpose of this project is push based metrics 
for use in personal projects or resource constrained clusters.

While it is nice to have Prometheus, Grafana and other tools 
it is not economical for a personal project. The mini-stats project
is designed, and intended to run in a single node k0s t3.small.
